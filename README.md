# Teensy-Controller
The goal is to build a fast controller for audio manipulation. For this, we will use the Teensy 4.1 and build all the necessary circuitery (conditionning, Analog conversion...) and codes.
* DAC using the MCP 4822 is done. More details in the corresponding file.
* External ADC, in progress.

Note: Work in Progress
